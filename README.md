<i>Teacher-AI</i> is a voice-to-AI-to-voice (v2ai2v) application built in React/Node to enable interactive, educational conversations with AI. Users can choose a subject to discuss and a conversational partner, then engage in a back-to-back voice conversation.

Practice job interviews while stretching. Dive into a book club discussion during home improvement tasks. The six default conversational partners are flexible and allow emergent conversations that change depending on user intention.

Features:

- Connects transcription, text-to-speech, and AI, enabling users to voice chat with AI
- Voice auto-detection for seamless conversations; the system detects when you talk and when you stop.
- Designed for desktop & mobile use
  - Tunnel via NGROK and access on your mobile device
- Six conversational partners are available:
  - Three teachers (lecture, discussion, and humor)
  - Mock job interview
  - Debate preparation
  - Broad conversation partner

## Prerequisites

Ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed and set up on your system:

1. **Node.js**: The application is built using Node.js, so you need to have it installed on your machine. You can download the latest version of Node.js from the [official website](https://nodejs.org/).

2. **Azure Cognitive Services Text to Speech**: The voice output feature of the application utilizes Azure Cognitive Services Text to Speech, a text-to-speech service. To use Azure Text to Speech, sign up for an Azure account and follow the steps to create a Text to Speech resource. Once you have your resource, obtain the API key from the Azure portal, and set it up in the .env file of the application. You can refer to the official Azure Text to Speech documentation for more information on setting up and obtaining the API key.

3. **OpenAI API Key**: The application requires an OpenAI API key for AI integration (Chat-GPT and Whisper Transcription). Sign up for an OpenAI account and obtain an API key from the [OpenAI Developer Dashboard](https://beta.openai.com/signup/). Once you have your API key, set it up in the `.env` file of the application.

## Getting Started with the Application

1. **Configure API keys:** Make sure your API keys are properly set up in the application.

2. **Initiate a session:** Type your message in the text input and press enter, or click the microphone icon to send a voice message.

3. **Understand the three phases:**

   - **User Input Phase:** The microphone is ready, it will capture your voice input to send it to the AI for processing once you begin talking.

   - **AI Processing phase:** Your recording is being handled by the APIs.

   - **AI Playing phase:** The generated response is played back to you.

4. **Engage with the AI:** By default, the application will automatically cycle through the phases. Be ready to respond to AI when it's your turn.

5. **Control the pace (optional):** If you need more time to respond, disable Automatic Detection and manually put the application into standby mode by clicking the microphone button when it's your turn.

6. **Speak in complete sentences:** For better transcription and understanding, use complete sentences when engaging with the AI.

## Options Menu

Find the options menu below the console with these available features:

- **Abandon Session**: Reset the session
- **Voices**: Change the AWS Polly voice
- **Prompts**: Modify the active AI conversation partner
- **Edit Prompt**: Modify the active prompt or set a custom prompt (requires a "system" message and an initial "assistant" message)
- **Automatic Detection**: Sets recording mode to standby after AI finishes playing their audio prompt. If you turn this off, you will have to click the Microphone button after the AI has spoken in order to set the Mic to standby and begin a recording.
- **Voice Threshold**: This slider sets the minimum volume level needed to trigger a recording from standby mode. Adjust based on background noise & experiment for best results.
- **Mic Pause Timer**: This slider sets the delay after a recording dips below the Volume Threshold that will trigger an automatic completion of the user recording.

## Microphone Statuses:

1. **Orange Border**: _Standby mode_ - awaiting voice to surpass the Voice Threshold and initiate recording.
2. **Red Border**: _Recording in progress_ - triggered by exceeding Voice Threshold, and will stop when volume falls below the threshold for the Mic Pause Timer duration.
3. **Grey Border**: _Inactive_ - AI is currently processing the conversation.
4. **White Border**: _Inactive_ - no session in progress.

## Prompts

- **Discussion**: A teacher who engages students by asking open-ended questions.
- **Lecture**: A teacher that prefers delivering comprehensive, informative presentations.
- **Humor**: A teacher that uses humor to engage students during lessons.
- **Debate**: A debate partner that helps someone prepare for a debate.
- **Talk**: A discussion partner capable of engaging in deep conversations on a variety of subjects.
- **Job Interview**: A job interview partner that helps someone prepare for a job interview.
